Picking up where we left off.

* javascript
* libraries
* what to choose

Do we really learn javascript by learning the libraries?
Or is it just a way of bad habits? , to learn something without truly learning them, as we never get to know what exactly is "under the hood"?
Would it instead maybe be a better idea to go around learning it the "slow" but more detailed way?
If we are to learn plain javascript and become a yedi master of it, whats to stop us then?
Im so early in the stages. but how i understand it, is that if we are to master plain javascript. we got close to no limits.
At least compared to the jQuery as it is just a small box of already created functions/methods.

And we haven't made those predefined methods ourself. and therefor it may be a bigger hazzle to start examine it and change in it, compared to just building our own method from scratch.

BUT.

Some could also argue about why we would ever want to re-invent the tire every time instead of just using the already made and already great and awesome stuff that is out there to help you?
Why go around learn the 20line way if we can learn the 3 line way and it is just as good.

And if we think about it.
vanilla js, jQuery. It is all the same when boiled down.
IT is all created from javascript. so maybe it is all about absorbing everything we can.
Learn from javascript, learn some jQuery learn everything we can.
And after time, it will all make some sense.
So when we know jQuery, there may not be that far to some other librarie?
or some vanilla js code line.
But my point is just that if we know vanilla js, we seem to know it all within the javascript world.

And this however is just a small world of the programming universe it seems.
But , they all kinda work the same, so by knowing 1, i assume it is alot easier to learn the next, and 3rd language.


I do however think it is hard to pick a place to focus.
Should it be front-end? back-end?
front-end and focus on e-commerce maybe?
There is so many choices, and fields to pick.
My idea at the moment is just to shoot about around and grab a bit of this and a bit of that, and maybe in the future i will have a grasp of it all, and have figured what i found interesting.

I do also believe that it take some experience to figure out what kind of work we actually like.
Not everyone just knows.

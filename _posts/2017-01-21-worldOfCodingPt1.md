title: World of code pt1
---
Some weeks ago now, i've decided to join up bloc, and take on the adventure of learning to code.
For quiet some years i've wanted to pursue this thing, and now i decided it was time!
My overall dream goal would be to become a freelancer.
the whole thing about being able to work from where ever and whenever suits me perfect.
and the whole developer part.
The idea of being able to create something from scratch.
To take ideas / designs from customers and bring them to life.
also the whole interactive part speaks to me.
What do people want on the homepage?
What makes them click stuff.
What makes create user-experience?
what makes our password secure?
There is a whole bunch of interesting topics i know nothing about, but i am curious about.

The whole development world is HUGE tho.
At least to me sitting from the outside trying to figure out what language/topic to explore.
We got front-end and back-end.
In front-end we may explore a language like javascript.
Inside of javascript we could use plain javascript, or we may try and go for some helper libraries ( jQuery, Dojo, React, raphaÃ«l, bootstrap)
And all of these libraries is actually still plain javascript.

Its just so instead of remembering the rather long code snippets that plain javascript can be.
We are now able to use a helper librarie, so instead of writing 10 lines of code, we may use a shortcut from the jQuery librarie that only takes in 2 lines of codes. but actually refers to the 10 lines of code.
And this may seem like a great idea. As we may actually need to "learn" less, and it may be easier to absorb 2 lines instead of 10.
